<h1>The Best Movies According to Jonathan </h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fast and Furious 5</h3>
<p>This is one franchise that i keep close to heart because of the thrill and action from the stunts</p>

<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>It's a really cool movie about an AI or robot imitating and fooling a human to escape from experiments</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>The top movie I tend to recommend to my friends as it's a great movie that closes out the dark knight trilogy</p>
